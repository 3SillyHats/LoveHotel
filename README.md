Love Hotel 
==========

It's all about frisky business in 3 Silly Hats' debut game: Love Hotel!
Build and manage a sexy hotel for lovestruck couples, making the most of a
skimpy budget and showing your guests a great time.

The rooms are perverse, the staff have peep holes in all the walls, and the
clients just want to leave without an empty wallet!

Satisfy your guests' fetishes with themed suites such as: spooning, tropical,
and chocolate moustache.

Eventually people will come from all over the world, and beyond, to stay at
your six-star Love Hotel!
